# YES_ReportIDsAndValues
Salesforce tool for reporting IDs and other field Values based on a look up

Created October-November 2018 by Jon Sayer of YES! Media. 
Offered to the nonprofit Salesforce community as open source software. Please make it better.

I have blatantly ripped off some code from these fine sources:
 - Importing & reading a CSV: 			https://sfdcsrini.blogspot.com/2014/09/data-import-from-csv-using-visualforce.html
 - Generating list of object fields: 	https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=9060G0000005UGKQA2
 - Sorting a Select list by value: 		https://success.salesforce.com/apex/ideaView?id=08730000000BrX6AAK
